<h4>FWHM Heat Map</h4>


Heat maps are generated using the median of a sliding window along the x and y axes. 

The window size and the step size for window movement are calculated based on bead density. 

Heat maps are pseudo colored and scaled in relation to the theoretical resolution (green).

The plots to the right represent projections of the parameters along the indicated axes. For 

scaling, two alternative options are possible and can be chosen from above: normalized scaling 

(based on the theoretical resolution) and absolute scaling (in &micro;m).
